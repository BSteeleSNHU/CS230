Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Gaming Room was a client that wanted to develop a game application, Draw It or Lose It. They wanted their application to be web-based, but able to be run on many different platforms. The client wanted to develop a cross-platform application, based off of their original Android application.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- In developing this documentation, I paid special attention to ensuring that I captured the UML diagram, just as it would need to be implemented in the application. This creates a much easier environment for developing all of the game components.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- I felt that doing the evaluation really helped to gain a deeper understanding of what the code was doing, and the availablility of opportunities that could be taken during the project. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I think that I could've been more detailed in my recommendations. I felt as though I covered the necessary material in the recommendations, but you can never be too detailed when it comes to shifting requirements of an application.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- I interpreted the user's needs in the evaluations of the different operating systems. This section gave me a deep understanding of what would need to happen on each unique operating system, so that I could ensure the application met the requirements for each user's operating system.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- When designing the software, I worked on implementing one requirement at a time. I found that it works best for me to break up the application into smaller subsets of tasks that can be accomplished and iterated. This gives me the opportunity to enhance the application as I go, and to debug as I work through the tasks as well.
